# Fisheye
This is a project made for my [Application's developer - Javascript React courses](https://openclassrooms.com/en/paths/516-developpeur-dapplication-javascript-react) from [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/en).

## Prerequisites
The project itself wont work without the Express js server I created to simulate the back end so please clone the following [repository](https://github.com/Zansuken/Fishey-server) and the client project (the repository you're actually visiting), then follow these instructions for both projects at their respective roots:

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
1. Run `npm run dev` to start the server.
